	Climate change is arguably the greatest danger facing our society, and its effects could have devastating impacts on every community on the planet. Communities located on oceanic coasts face the likelihood of rising sea levels and hurricanes that will increase in both size and frequency, both of which exacerbate issues of flooding. One such place is New York City, the largest city by population in the United States. New York is an incredibly diverse city, perhaps the most so on Earth, with a majority-minority population and hundreds of spoken languages. However, it is also a city of great inequality, famously home to many of the world’s wealthiest people, but also with a poverty rate higher than the national average. The combination of these facts posed an interesting set of questions for us to explore: when flooding occurs, what kinds of people in New York are most at risk? As climate change worsens, who will be most in danger of these hazards? And lastly, in terms of designing climate change resilience projects, can our findings inform policy decisions? 
	In order to investigate these questions, we examined both historical and projected data concerning flooding in New York and its surrounding suburbs and developed several models to examine the relationship between demographic data and a given area’s risk of flooding. Although there is obviously no causal relationship between an area’s demographics and its risks of flooding in a storm, we wanted to see if there were strong correlations, as other cities could potentially use one of our models in order to see if they are leaving marginalized communities at an outsized risk. We used census tracts as our unit of analysis and pulled a wide array of demographic data from the American Community Survey, using the 5-year average as of 2020. We then joined this data with the 2050s 500-year floodplain, a map showing what areas of the city are projected to be flooded in the event of a storm that has a 1 in 500 chance of happening in a given year. By using projections based on the sea level rise expected by 2050, we can model what could happen in the event of a storm that is very unlikely to happen in a single year, but likelier over the course of many years or decades. Since a single storm of this magnitude could prove absolutely devastating for the millions of people who live in New York, it is prudent to examine a worst-case scenario, particularly since projections concerning climate change have been repeatedly shown to be overly optimistic. We cleaned both sets of data and performed exploratory data analysis to examine the immediate relationships between flooding and various demographic metrics. 
	To see if we could devise a model that could predict whether or not a census tract was in the floodplain based on its demographics, we created a decision tree model, a logistic regression model, and a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model, finding that the KNN model was the best. However, our logistic regression model highlighted some of the most important predictor variables, finding the strongest relationship between unemployment rates and a tract’s likelihood of being within the floodplain. 
	We then looked at historical data to see if we could model the damage that might be inflicted by future storms on different demographics using Superstorm Sandy, as it was the most recent weather event to severely flood the city. We then cleaned a dataset showing the damage and water levels inflicted by Sandy. To see if we could create models that could predict the level of damage based on demographic data, we used a Random Forest model, an elastic net model, and a KNN model, finding that the random forest was the most accurate, as it had the lowest root mean square error of the three models.
	Our finding that an area’s likelihood of lying in the floodplain and that area’s employment rate is useful. Wealthy individuals in these areas may have the means to avoid a storm or flood in an alternate home or hotel, while poorer individuals may not have the means to do this, and a wide inequality would increase the mean of the household income, which could obscure how many vulnerable people live in these areas. New York must ensure that climate resilience projects are focused in areas with high rates of unemployment and poverty. In addition, as our model was quite accurate, other cities could use similar models and see if they too can predict an area’s likelihood of exposure to severe flooding based on demographic data. Even though we did not find that some metrics, such as race or household income, were strongly predictive of flooding, the framework of this model could prove useful for governments who want to examine which types of people are most vulnerable to flooding. In addition, our modeling of the damage inflicted by Sandy be of use in preparing finances for repairs and insurance claims in the wake of floods.
