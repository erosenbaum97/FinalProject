## Overview:
-----------------------------

#### Project Title 



##### Summary & Motivating Question 
This project is on environmental justice and climate change resilience. Our project focuses on New York City, a coastal city vulnerable to floods and hurricanes due to its extensively used waterfronts and coast. It is estimated that by 2050, 659,000 people in New York will be at risk to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels, and this risk is expected to rise in the future with worsening climate change. Using Geospatial Analysis, API Pulls and Supervised Machine Learning, we explore the impact of flooding on various areas in the state of New York. We explore the levels of impact experienced based on factors such as race, income, age, educational attainment, and population density to see if disparities exist. We also identify and predict the areas most prone to flooding, and potential damages based on population.

##### The Project Goal: 
The project is to provide insight into the staggering impact of climate change, provide insight and visibility into the needs of populations at risk, and help inform policy. Below we have listed our data sources, intended techniques, and anticipated technical hurdles. 


##### Findings
The model is poor because it using a training data frame to use the training and does not use cross validation and tuning 

The model

##### Recommendations



##### Policy Implications 
- [ ] To be able to access and understand populations at the most risk of losing property and livelihood due to natural disasters such as flooding and hurricanes 
- [ ]  To inform policy on ways to anticipate, better target, and reduce the vulnerability of populations most at risk
